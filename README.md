# Predictive Learning Algorithm

Machine Learning Algorithms to solve the common problems faced by students in their academic life and tried to solve or at least ease their problems which includes tracking their performance in real time and as well as giving them future predictions so they can adjust their learning curve accordingly. 
Initially weak machine learning algorithms were used like, Naïve Bayes, Linear Regression, SVM, etc. further these were improved by the use of machine learning boosting algorithms (AdaBoost) and obtained high accuracy in the predictions.
The data’s that were used in this project was student’s marks, attendance, number of f grades, class pass percentage, placement records, etc. We were able to predict the scores of students in particular subject wise at an accuracy rate of above 80%. While we also predicted the future placement probability of a student with an accuracy of above 85%.
Finally, this project was validated by predicting the student’s placement information, their marks, and interest graph. 
Further this project can be implemented in a number of instances where the activities can be tracked and relevant predictions can be made, like corporate employees etc.
